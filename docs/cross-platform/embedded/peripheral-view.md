The Peripheral View allows embedded developers to view and manipulate registers and peripherals defined SVD (System View Description) files.

## Usage

The Peripheral View presents the registers in a tree-view. To navigate this view, scroll up and down to view the various periphels and click the dropdown caret in order to view individual registers.

### Modifying register values

In order to modify peripheral values double click the value of the register, enter the desired value, and press enter to save the new value.
