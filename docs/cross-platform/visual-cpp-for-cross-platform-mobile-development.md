# Cross-platform mobile development with C++

You can build native C++ apps for iOS, Android, and Windows devices by using the cross-platform tools available in Visual Studio. **Mobile development with C++** is a workload available in the Visual Studio installer. It installs the SDKs and tools you need for cross-platform development of shared libraries and native apps. When it's installed, you can use C++ to create code that runs on iOS and Android devices and platforms, Windows, Windows Store, and Xbox.

Writing code for multiple platforms is often frustrating. The primary development languages and tools for iOS, Android, and Windows are different on each platform. However, all platforms support writing code in C++. It's the common denominator that can enable reuse of core code across platforms. Native code written in C++ can be both more performant and resistant to reverse engineering. Code reuse can save both time and effort when creating apps for multiple platforms.

Development using C++ for cross-platform mobile development has several advantages:

- **Easy installation.** The Visual Studio installer acquires and installs the required third-party tools and SDKs you need to build apps or libraries for Android and iOS. Configuration and setup are simple and mostly automatic.

- **A powerful and familiar build environment.** Create sharable cross-platform solutions and projects easily with Visual Studio templates. Manage properties for all projects using one common interface. Edit all your code in the Visual Studio editor, and take advantage of the built-in cross-platform IntelliSense for code completion and error highlighting.

- **A unified debugging experience.** Use the world-class debugging tools in Visual Studio to watch and step through C++ code on all platforms: Android devices and emulators, iOS simulators and devices, and Windows or Windows Store devices and emulators.

## Get the tools

Mobile development with C++ is an installable workload that comes with Visual Studio. For prerequisites and installation instructions, see [Install cross-platform mobile development with C++](../cross-platform/install-visual-cpp-for-cross-platform-mobile-development.md). To build code for iOS, you also need a Mac computer and an Apple iOS Developer Account. For more information, see [Install and configure tools to build using iOS](../cross-platform/install-and-configure-tools-to-build-using-ios.md).

## Try out sample code

Download samples that show how to create shared code libraries you can use in Windows, Android, and iOS apps. And, see examples of how to create complete Native Activity apps for Android. To get started, see [Cross-platform mobile development examples](../cross-platform/cross-platform-mobile-development-examples.md).
