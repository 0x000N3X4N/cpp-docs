# Warning C6392

> This expression will write the value of the pointer to the stream; if this is intentional, add an explicit cast to 'void *'

This rule was added in Visual Studio 2022 17.8.

## Remarks

In C++, we have streams of wide characters, like `std::wostringstream`, and streams of nonwide characters like `std::ostringstream`. Trying to print a wide character literal to a nonwide string calls the `void*` overload of `operator<<`. This overload prints the address of the wide string literal instead of the value.

Code analysis name: `STREAM_OUTPUT_VOID_PTR`

## Example

In the following code snippet, we print the value of the pointer to the standard output instead of the string `"Foo"`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << L"Foo\n"; // Warning: C6392
}
```

There are multiple ways to fix this error. If printing the pointer value is unintended, we can use a nonwide string literal:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Foo\n"; // No warning.
}
```

Alternatively, we can use a wide stream:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::wcout << L"Foo\n"; // No warning.
}
```

If the behavior is intentional, we can silence the warning using an explicit cast:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << static_cast<void*>(L"Foo\n"); // No warning.
}
```
