# Warning C6272

> Non-float passed as argument '\**number*' when float is required in call to '\**function-name*'

This warning indicates that the format string specifies that a float is required, for example, a `%f` or `%g` specification for `printf,` but a non-float such as an integer or string is being passed.

## Remarks

This defect is likely to result in incorrect output and, in certain circumstances, could result in a crash.

Code analysis name: NON_FLOAT_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION

## Example

The following code generates this warning. `%f` indicates a float is expected, but the integer `i` is passed isntead:

```cpp
void f()
{
     char buff[5];
     int i=5;
     sprintf_s(buff, "%s %f", "a", i);
}
```

To correct this warning, use `%i` instead of `%f` specification as shown in the following code:

```cpp
void f()
{
     char buff[5];
     int i=5;
     sprintf_s(buff, "%s %i", "a", i);
}
```
