# C26825: NULLPTR_POSTCONDITION_VIOLATION_MAYBE

Dereferencing a null pointer is frequent problem in C and C++. We have a variety of checks to deal with such problems. See this [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/improved-null-pointer-dereference-detection-in-visual-studio-2022-version-17-0-preview-4/) for a comparison. When the analysis engine see a potentially null pointer returned from a function that has a contract forbidding such operation, it will emit a `C26825` warning. You can enable [C26824](../code-quality/c26824.md) only for a more permissive analysis. This check only works on functions annotated using [SAL annotations](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/code-quality/understanding-sal).


## Example

```cpp
void postcondition_conditional(int *q, _Outptr_ int** p)  { 
    *p = q; // C26825 warning 
} 
```

To solve this warning, make sure there is no null pointer is returned from the annotated function or change the annotations to reflect the behavior of the function.
