# Warning C6395

> %variable% has unsequenced reads and/or writes before C++17; changing the language standard might change the behavior of the code

## Remarks

C++17 made the evaluation order of certain expressions stricter. MSVC implements a different evaluation order before C++17. Changing the language version can result in changes for the observable behavior of the program. This check attempts to diagnose some of the cases where the meaning of the code can change when switching language versions.

Code analysis name: `EVAL_ORDER_CHANGE`

## Example

```cpp
void foo(int* a, int i)
{
    a[++i] = i; // Warning: 'i' has unsequenced reads and/or writes before C++17; changing the language standard might change the behavior of the code
}
```

To solve this problem, separate the side effects from the rest of the expression to make the evaluation order well defined:

```cpp
void foo(int* a, int i)
{
    ++i;
    a[i] = i; // No warning.
}
```
