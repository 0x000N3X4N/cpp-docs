# Warning C6217

> Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: testing HRESULT with 'not'. Consider using [`SUCCEEDED`](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) or [`FAILED`](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed) macro instead.

## Remarks

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is tested with the logical-not (`!`) operator. A success (`S_OK`) in an `HRESULT` is indicated by a value of 0. However, 0 also indicates failure for a Boolean type. Testing `HRESULT` with the logical-not operator (`!`) to determine which code block to run can cause incorrect behavior or code that is confusing to future maintainers.

To verify whether an `HRESULT` is a success or failure, use the `SUCCEEDED` or `FAILED` macros instead.

This warning works for both `HRESULT` and `SCODE` types.

Code analysis name: `TESTING_HRESULT_WITH_NOT`

## Example

The following code generates this warning because the logical-not (`!`) operator is used to determine success or failure of an `HRESULT` value. In this case, the wrong code path is executed because `( !hr )` runs the failure code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <objbase.h>

void f( )
{
  HRESULT hr = CoInitialize(NULL);
  if (!hr)
  {
    // failure code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, the following code uses a `FAILED` macro to check for failure:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <objbase.h>

void f( )
{
  HRESULT hr = CoInitialize(NULL);
  if (FAILED(hr))
  {
    // failure code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
  }
}
```
