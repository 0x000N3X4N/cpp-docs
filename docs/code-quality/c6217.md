# Warning C6217

> Implicit cast between semantically different integer types: testing HRESULT with 'not'. Consider using [`SUCCEEDED`](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-succeeded) or [`FAILED`](/windows/desktop/api/winerror/nf-winerror-failed) macro instead.

## Remarks

This warning indicates that an `HRESULT` is being tested with the logical-not (`!`) operator. A success (`S_OK`) in `HRESULT` is indicated by a value of 0. However, 0 indicates failure for a Boolean type. Testing `HRESULT` with the logical-not operator (`!`) to determine which code block to run can cause following the wrong code path. This test will lead to unwanted results.

Code analysis name: `TESTING_HRESULT_WITH_NOT`

## Example

The following code generates this warning because the logical-not operator is used to determine success or failure of an `HRESULT` value. In this case, wrong code path is executed because `( !hr )` runs the failure code:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <objbase.h>

void f( )
{
  HRESULT hr = CoInitialize(NULL);
  if (!hr)
  {
    // failure code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
  }
}
```

To correct this warning, the following code uses `FAILED` macro to look for failure:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
#include <objbase.h>

void f( )
{
  HRESULT hr = CoInitialize(NULL);
  if (FAILED(hr))
  {
    // failure code ...
  }
  else
  {
    // success code ...
  }
}
```

For this warning, the `SCODE` type is equivalent to `HRESULT`.

The typical success value of HRESULT (`S_OK`) is **`false`** when it's tested as a Boolean.

To verify whether `HRESULT` is a success, use the `SUCCEEDED` macro instead.
