# Warning C6001

> Using uninitialized memory '*variable*'.

## Remarks

This warning is reported when an uninitialized local variable is used before it's assigned a value. This usage could lead to unpredictable results. You should always initialize variables before use.

Code analysis name: `USING_UNINIT_VAR`

## Example

The following code generates this warning because variable `i` is only initialized if `b` is true; otherwise an uninitialized `i` is returned:

```cpp
int f( bool b )
{
   int i;
   if ( b )
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   return i; // i is uninitialized if b is false
}
```

To correct this warning, initialize the variable as shown in the following code:

```cpp
int f( bool b )
{
   int i = -1;

   if ( b )
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   return i;
}
```

## Heuristics

Variables are considered initialized when they're passed by reference to another function. The following example shows that `i` is assumed to be initialized by the function it's passed to.

```cpp
void init( int& i );

int f( bool b )
{
   int i;

   init(i);

   if ( b )
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   return i; // i is assumed to be initialized by init(i)
}
```

This supports the pattern of passing a pointer to a variable into an initialization function.

This heuristic can lead to false negatives because many functions expect pointers that point to initialized data. Use [SAL annotations](annotating-function-parameters-and-return-values.md), such as `_In_` and `_Out_`, to describe the function's behavior. The following example calls a function that expects its argument to be initialized, so a warning is generated:

```cpp
void use( _In_ int& i );

int f( bool b )
{
   int i;

   use(i); // uninitialized variable warning because of _In_ annotation on use() declaration

   if ( b )
   {
      i = 0;
   }
   return i;
}
```
