# C28159
# Warning C28159

> warning C28159: Consider using another function instead.
> Consider using `\**function_name_1*` instead of `\**function_name_2*`. Reason: `\**reason*`
This warning is reported for Drivers is suggesting that you use a preferred function call that is semantically equivalent to the function that the driver is calling. This is a general warning message; the annotation `__drv_preferredFunction` was used (possibly with a conditional a `__drv_when`() annotation) to flag a bad coding practice.
This warning occurs when that you use a function that is semantically equivalent to an alternative, preferred function call. 

## Remarks

This is a general warning message; the annotation `__drv_preferredFunction` was used (possibly with a conditional a `__drv_when`() annotation) to flag a bad coding practice.

Code analysis name: USE_OTHER_FUNCTION

## Example

The following code example generates this warning:
The following code example generates this warning. This issue is due to the use of `OemToChar`, which does not validate the buffer size:

```cpp
char buff[MAX_PATH];
OemToChar(buff, input);  // If strlen(input) > MAX_PATH, this call leads to buffer overrun
```

The following code example avoids this warning:
The following code example avoids this warning by using the recommended alternative `OemToCharBuff`, which takes in the destination buffer size and limits the copy appropriatly:

```cpp
char buff[MAX_PATH];
OemToCharBuff(buff, input, MAX_PATH);
```
