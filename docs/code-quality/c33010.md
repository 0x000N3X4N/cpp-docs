# Warning C33010

> Unchecked lower bound for enum '\**enum_name*' used as index.

This warning is triggered if an enum is both used as an index into an array and isn't checked on the lower bound.

## Remarks

Code using enumerated types as indexes for arrays will often check for the upper bound in order to ensure the index is not out of range. Because an enum variable is signed by default, it can have a negative value. If it is used as an index into an array of values or an array of function pointers, a negative value can allow arbitrary memory to be read, used, or even executed.

Code analysis name: UNCHECKED_LOWER_BOUND_FOR_ENUMINDEX

## Example

The following code generates this warning. `idx` is used as an index to access `functions`, but the lower bound is never checked.

```cpp
typedef void (*PFN)();

enum class Index
{
    Zero,
    One,
    Two,
    Three,
    Max
};

void foo(Index idx, PFN(&functions)[5])
{
    if (idx > Index::Max)
        return;

    auto pfn = functions[static_cast<int>(idx)];
    if (pfn != nullptr)
        (*pfn)();
}
```

These following code remediates this warning by checking the lower bound as well to ensure `idx` is not negative:

```cpp
typedef void (*PFN)();

enum class Index
{
    Zero,
    One,
    Two,
    Three,
    Max
};

void foo(Index idx, PFN(&functions)[5])
{
    if (idx < Index::Zero || idx > Index::Max)
        return;

    auto pfn = functions[static_cast<int>(idx)];
    if (pfn != nullptr)
        (*pfn)();
}
```
