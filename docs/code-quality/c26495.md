# Warning C26495

> Variable '\**parameter-name*' is uninitialized. Always initialize a member variable (type.6).

## Remarks

A member variable isn't initialized by a constructor or by an initializer. Make sure all variables are initialized by the end of construction. For more information, see C++ Core Guidelines [Type.6](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#SS-type) and [C.48](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#c48-prefer-in-class-initializers-to-member-initializers-in-constructors-for-constant-initializers).

Code analysis name: MEMBER_UNINIT

## Example

The following sample generates warning C26495 because the member variable `value` isn't initialized when a `MyStruct` object is created.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int value;
    MyStruct() {} // C26495, MyStruct::value is uninitialized
};
```

To resolve the issue, you can add in-class initialization to all of the member variables.

```cpp
struct MyStruct
{
    int value{};  // empty brace initializer sets value to 0
    MyStruct() {} // no warning, MyStruct::value is set via default member initialization
};
```
