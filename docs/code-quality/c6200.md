# Warning C6200

> Index '*index*' is out of valid index range '*min*' to '*max*' for non-stack buffer '*parameter-name*'

This warning indicates that an integer offset into the specified non-stack array exceeds the maximum bounds of that array, potentially causing random behavior and/or crashes.

## Remarks

One common cause of this defect is using the size of an array as an index into the array. Because C/C++ array indexing is zero-based, the maximum legal index into an array is one less than the number of array elements.

Code analysis name: `INDEX_EXCEEDS_MAX_NONSTACK`

## Example

The following code generates this warning. This issue stems from the **`for`** loop exceeding the index range, attempting to access index 14 (the 15th element) when index 13 (the 14th element) is the last:

```cpp
void f()
{
    int* buff = new int[14]; // array of 0..13 elements
    for (int i = 0; i <= 14; i++) // i exceeds the index
    {
        buff[i] = 0; // warning C6200
    }
    delete[] buff;
}
```

To correct both warnings, use correct array size as shown in the following code:

```cpp
void f()
{
    int* buff = new int[14]; // array of 0..13 elements
    for (int i = 0; i < 14; i++) // i == 13 on the final iteration
    {
        buff[i] = 0; // initialize buffer
    }
    delete[] buff;
}
```
