# Warning C28213

> The `_Use_decl_annotations_` annotation must be used to reference, without modification, a prior declaration.

## Remarks

`_Use_decl_annotations_` tells the compiler to use the annotations from an earlier declaration of the function.  If no earlier declaration can be found, or if the current declaration makes changes to the annotations than this warning is emitted.

Code analysis name: BAD_USEHEADER

## Example

The following code generates C28160. The `buffer` parameter annotation does not match between the two files.

*From example.h:*

```cpp
void example_func(_Out_writes_(n) char* buffer, int n);
```

*From example.cpp:*

```cpp
_Use_decl_annotations_
void example_func(_Out_writes_z_(n) char* buffer, int n)
{
    buffer[n] = '\0';
}
```

This can be fixed by either changing the annotation so they match at all locations, or by removing all annotations except `_Use_decl_annotations_` from the function definition. In this example, `_Out_writes_z_` appears to be correct so we will move that to the function declaration in the header file. The following code resolves this warning:

*From example.h:*

```cpp
void example_func(_Out_writes_z_(n) char* buffer, int n);
```

*From example.cpp:*

```cpp
_Use_decl_annotations_
void example_func(_Out_writes_z_(n) char* buffer, int n)
{
    buffer[n] = '\0';
}
```
