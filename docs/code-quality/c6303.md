# Warning C6303

> Format string mismatch: wide character string passed as parameter '\**number*' when character string is required in call to '\**function-name*'

This warning indicates that a format string is being passed a wide character string when a narrow character string is specified.

## Remarks

This defect is likely to cause a crash or corruption of some form.

Code analysis name: WCHAR_CHAR_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION

## Example

The following sample code generates this warning. `buff` is a wide character string, but the `printf_s` call expects a short string as denoted by `%s`:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
    wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";
    printf_s("%s", buff);
}
```

To correct this warning, use `%ls` (the wide character variant of `%s` as shown in the following sample code:

```cpp
#include <stdio.h>

void f()
{
    wchar_t buff[5] = L"hi";
    printf_s("%ls", buff);
}
```
