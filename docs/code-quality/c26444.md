# Warning C26444

> Don't try to declare a local variable with no name (es.84).

## C++ Core Guidelines

[ES.84: Don't (try to) declare a local variable with no name](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Res-noname)

Unnamed temporary objects with nontrivial behavior may point to either (a) inefficient code that allocates and immediately throws away resources or (b) to the code that unintentionally ignores nonprimitive data. Sometimes it may also indicate plainly wrong declaration.

## Remarks

- This rule detects types with nontrivial destructors. Keep in mind that destructors can be compiler generated.
- The warning can flag code that invokes a nontrivial constructor of a RAII type.
- The logic skips temporaries if they're used in higher-level expressions. One example is temporaries that are passed as arguments or used to invoke a function.

Code analysis name: `NO_UNNAMED_RAII_OBJECTS`

## Examples

```cpp
struct A { A(int i); ~A(); };
void Foo()
{
    A{42}; // warning C26444: Don't try to declare a local variable with no name (es.84).
}
```

To fix the issue, convert the temporary object to a local.

```cpp
struct A { A(int i); ~A(); };
void Foo()
{
    A guard{42}; // OK.
}
```
