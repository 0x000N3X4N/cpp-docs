# C26409 NO_NEW_DELETE

> `Avoid calling new and delete explicitly, use std::make_unique<T> instead (r.11).`

Even if code is clean of calls to`malloc()` and `free()`, we still suggest that you consider better options than explicit use of operators [`new` and `delete`](../cpp/new-and-delete-operators.md).

**C++ Core Guidelines**:\
[R.11: Avoid calling new and delete explicitly](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#r11-avoid-calling-new-and-delete-explicitly)

The ultimate fix is to use smart pointers and appropriate factory functions, such as [`std::make_unique`](../standard-library/memory-functions.md#make_unique).

## Remarks

- The checker warns on calls to any kind of operator **`new`** or **`delete`**: scalar, vector, overloaded versions (global and class-specific), and placement versions. The placement **`new`** case may require some clarifications in the Core Guidelines for suggested fixes, and may be omitted in the future.

## Example

This example shows C26409 is raised for explicit **`new`** and **`delete`**. Consider using smart pointer factory functions such as `std::make_unique` instead.

```cpp
void f(int i)
{
    int* arr = new int[i]{}; // C26409, warning is issued for all new calls
    delete[] arr;            // C26409, warning is issued for all delete calls

    auto unique = std::make_unique<int[]>(i); // prefer using smart pointers over new and delete
}
```

There is a C++ idiom `delete this` that triggers this warning. The warning is intentional as this pattern is discouraged by the C++ Core Guidelines. The warning can be suppressed using the `gsl::suppress` attribute in such cases. See the example below.

```cpp
    class MyReferenceCountingObject final
    {
    public:
        void AddRef();
        void Release() noexcept
        {
            ref_count_--;
            if (ref_count_ == 0)
            {
                [[gsl::suppress(r.11)]]
                delete this; 
            }
        }
    private:
        unsigned int ref_count_{1};
    };
```
