# C26824: NULLPTR_POSTCONDITION_VIOLATION

Dereferencing a null pointer is frequent problem in C and C++. We have a variety of checks to deal with such problems. See this [blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/improved-null-pointer-dereference-detection-in-visual-studio-2022-version-17-0-preview-4/) for a comparison. When the analysis engine sees a null pointer returned from a function that has a contract forbidding such operation, it will emit a `C26824` warning. You can also enable [C26825](../code-quality/c26825.md) for a stricter analysis. This check only works on functions annotated using [SAL annotations](../code-quality/understanding-sal.md).


## Example

```cpp
void postcondition_conditional(bool b, _When_(b == true, _Outptr_) int** p)  { 
    if (b == true) 
        *p = nullptr; // C26824 warning 
} 
```

To solve this warning, make sure there is no null pointer returned from the annotated function or change the annotations to reflect the behavior of the function.
