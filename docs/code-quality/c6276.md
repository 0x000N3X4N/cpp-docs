# Warning C6276

> Cast between semantically different string types: char* to wchar_t\*. Use of invalid string can lead to undefined behavior.

This warning indicates a potentially incorrect cast from an narrow character string (`char_t*`) to a wide character string (`wchar_t *`).

## Remarks

Because the Microsoft compiler implements wide strings with a character size of 2 bytes, casting from a narrow string might produce strings that aren't correctly terminated. If you use such strings with the `wcs*` functions in the runtime library, they could cause buffer overruns and access violations.
 
 Code analysis name: CHAR_TO_WCHAR_CAST

## Example

The following code generates this warning. It's caused by an improper cast of the narrow string `a` (2 bytes, one for the 'a' and one for the null terminator) to a wide string (a 2-byte wide character 'a' with no null terminator):

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f()
{
    WCHAR szBuffer[8];
    LPWSTR pSrc;
    pSrc = (LPWSTR)"a";
    wcscpy_s(szBuffer, pSrc);
}
```

The following code corrects this warning. It removes the problem cast and adds an `L` prefix to the string to define it as a properly terminated wide character string:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>

void f()
{
    WCHAR szBuffer[8];
    LPWSTR pSrc;
    pSrc = L"a";
    wcscpy_s(szBuffer, pSrc);
}
```
