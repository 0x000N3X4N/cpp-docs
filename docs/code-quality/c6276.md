# Warning C6276

> Cast between semantically different string types: char* to wchar_t\*. Use of invalid string can lead to undefined behavior.

This warning indicates a potentially incorrect cast from an ANSI string (`char_t*`) to a UNICODE string (`wchar_t *`).

## Remarks

Because UNICODE strings have a character size of 2 bytes, this cast might yield strings that aren't correctly terminated. Using such strings with the `wcs*` library of functions could cause buffer overruns and access violations.
 
 Code analysis name: CHAR_TO_WCHAR_CAST

## Example

The following code generates this warning. This issue stems from the improper casting of the character 'a' (1 byte) to a Unicode character (2 bytes):

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
void f()
{
    WCHAR szBuffer[8];
    LPWSTR pSrc;
    pSrc = (LPWSTR)"a";
    wcscpy_s(szBuffer, pSrc);
}
```

The following code corrects this warning by appending the letter L to represent the ASCII character as a wide character:

```cpp
#include <windows.h>
void f()
{
    WCHAR szBuffer[8];
    LPWSTR pSrc;
    pSrc = L"a";
    wcscpy_s(szBuffer, pSrc);
}
```
