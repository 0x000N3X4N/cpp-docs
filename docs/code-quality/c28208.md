# Warning C28208

> Function `\**function_name*` was previously defined with a different parameter list at `\**file_name*`(`\**line_number*`). Some analysis tools will yield incorrect results

## Remarks

This warning will almost always accompany [Compiler Warning (level 1) C4028](/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-1-c4028?view=msvc-170). Both warn of a mismatch between the parameters of a function's declaration and its definition. However, this specific error indicates a more niche case than C4028. C28208 indicates not only that a mismatch exists, but that it also can cause issues with analysis tools. This warning most notably occurs when the mismatch exists between a `typedef` function pointer and the definition of that function. This is demonstrated in the example below.

Code analysis name: FUNCTION_TYPE_REDECLARATION

## Example

The following code will generate C28208. `test_type` takes in a void pointer in its declaration, but `my_test1` takes in an integer pointer instead. `my_test2` remediates this issue by making sure the definition parameter match the declaration parameters.

*From example.h:*

```cpp
typedef void test_type(void*);
```

*From example.cpp:*

```cpp
test_type my_test1;
test_type my_test2;
void my_test1(int* x){};  // Will generate C28208
void my_test2(void* x){};  // Will not generate C28208

int main()
{
    // Code
}
```
