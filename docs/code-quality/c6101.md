# Warning C6101

> Returning uninitialized memory '*parameter-name*'.

A successful path through the function doesn't set the `_Out_` annotated parameter.

## Remarks

The purpose of this warning is to avoid the use of uninitialized values by callers of the function. The analyzer assumes all parameters annotated with `_Out_` are uninitialized before the function call, and checks that they're initialized by it. This warning isn't emitted if the function returns a value indicating it had an error or wasn't successful. To fix this issue, make sure the `_Out_` parameter is initialized under all successful return paths. The error message contains the line numbers of an example path that doesn't initialize the parameter.

If the initialization behavior is by design, then the warning is likely caused by incorrect or missing SAL annotations. You can typically resolve these cases by either changing `_Out_` to a more appropriate annotation, or by using the `_Success_()` annotation to help define the success/error states of the function. Having correct annotations on the function is important for the static analysis tools when analyzing the call sites of the function.

### Fix by changes to parameter annotations

If the parameter is expected to already be in an initialized state and the function conditionally modifies it, then the `_Inout_` annotation may be more appropriate. Another option is to use lower level annotations such as `_Pre_null_`, `_Pre_satisfies_()`, and `_Post_satisfies_()` that provide extra flexibility and control over the expected state of the parameter. For more information on parameter annotations, see [Annotating function parameters and return values](./annotating-function-parameters-and-return-values.md).

### Fix by defining successful return paths

This diagnostic is only emitted when the `_Out_` parameter isn't initialized in the success paths of the function. If there's no `_Success_` annotation and the return type for the function isn't annotated, then all return paths are considered successful. For more information on `_Success_` and similar annotations, see [Success/Failure annotations](./annotating-function-behavior.md#successfailure-annotations).

Code analysis name: `RETURN_UNINIT_VAR`

## Example

The following code generates this warning. Because the function returns void, all paths are considered successful. In this case, the correct fix would probably be to adjust the logic of the `if` statement, but in real world code it's typically not as straightforward and depends on the intended behavior of the function.

```cpp
#include <sal.h>
void AlwaysInit(_Out_ int* output, int input) // : warning C6101: Returning uninitialized memory '*p'.: Lines: 2, 4, 9, 14, 2
{
  if( input > 0 )
  {
    *output = input;
    return;
  }
  else if( input < 0 )
  {
    *output = 0;
    return;
  }
  return; // Oops, input was 0
}
```

To make the solution more interesting, we assume that it isn't valid to initialize `output` when `input` is `0`. One approach is to modify the function return value to a different type, such as `bool`. Then, add a `_Success_` annotation to define the successful return paths.

```cpp
_Success_(return == true)
bool InitNotZero(_Out_ int* output, int input)
{
  if( input > 0 )
  {
    *output = input;
    return true;
  }
  else if( input < 0 )
  {
    *output = 0;
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

If this pattern is common in your codebase, you can add the annotation to the return type. Error codes such as HRESULT from the Windows SDK give you the behavior of the `_Success_` annotation without needing to add it to each function. If you already use an annotated type as a return type and want to override the behavior, then add the annotation to the function, as shown in the previous example.

```cpp
using SuccessWhenTrue = _Success_(return == true) bool;

SuccessWhenTrue InitNotZero(_Out_ int* output, int input)
{
  // ...
}
```
