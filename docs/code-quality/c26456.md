# Warning C26456

Hiding base methods that aren't virtual is error prone and makes code harder to read.

[C++ Core Guideline for this warning](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#c128-virtual-functions-should-specify-exactly-one-of-virtual-override-or-final)
