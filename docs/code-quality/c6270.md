# Warning C6270

> Missing float argument to '*function-name*': add a float argument corresponding to conversion specifier '*number*'

This warning indicates that not enough arguments are being provided to match a format string; at least one of the missing arguments is a floating-point number.

## Remarks

This defect can lead to crashes, in addition to potentially incorrect output.

Code analysis name: MISSING_FLOAT_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION

## Example

The following code generates this warning. `sprintf_s` expects a second float argument as denoted by `%f` but none is provided:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff [25];
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %f", "pi: ");
}
```

To correct this warning, pass the missing float argument as shown in the following code:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff [25];
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %f", "pi: ", 3.14159);
}
```
