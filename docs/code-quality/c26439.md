# Warning C26439

> This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept'.

[**C++ Core Guidelines** F.6](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#Rf-noexcept): If your function must not throw, declare it noexcept

Some kinds of operations should never throw exceptions. Their implementations should be reliable and should handle possible errors conditions gracefully. They should never use exceptions to indicate failure. This rule flags cases where such operations aren't explicitly marked as `noexcept`, which means that they may throw exceptions and can't convey assumptions about their reliability.

It is important for these operations to be reliable as they are often used to implement operations with certain [exception safety guarantees](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/exceptions). A throwing move constructor could also force STL containers to fall back to copy operations and reduce the runtime performance.

Code analysis name: `SPECIAL_NOEXCEPT`

## Remarks

- Special kinds of operations:
  - destructors;
  - move constructors and move assignment operators;
  - standard functions with move semantics: `std::move` and `std::swap`.

- Non-standard and outdated specifiers like `throw()` or `declspec(nothrow)` aren't equivalent to `noexcept`.

- Explicit specifiers `noexcept(false)` and `noexcept(true)` are respected appropriately.

## Example

All functions except the destructor will warn because they're missing noexcept.

```cpp
struct S
{
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)
    S& operator=(S&& s) {/*impl*/} // C26439, This kind of function may not throw. Declare it 'noexcept' (f.6)

    S(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
    S& operator=(const S& s) {/*impl*/} // C26440, This function can be declared 'noexcept'
};
```

With noexcept decorating the same structure, all warnings are removed.

```cpp
struct S
{
    ~S() {}

    S(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(S&& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}

    S(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
    S& operator=(const S& s) noexcept {/*impl*/}
};
```
