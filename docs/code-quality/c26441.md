# Warning C26441

> Guard objects must be named (cp.44)

## C++ Core Guidelines

[CP.44](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines#cp44-remember-to-name-your-lock_guards-and-unique_locks): Remember to name your `lock_guard`s and `unique_lock`s

## Remarks

The standard library provides locks to help control concurrent access to resources during their lifetime. When you declare a lock object without a name, the compiler creates a temporary object that's immediately destructed rather than one that lives to the end of the enclosing scope. So, failure to assign a lock object to a variable is a mistake that effectively disables the locking mechanism (because temporary variables are transient). This rule catches simple cases of such unintended behavior.

This diagnostic only analyzes the standard lock types `std::scoped_lock`, `std::unique_lock`, and `std::lock_guard`. Warning [C26444](c26444.md) covers other unnamed RAII types.

The analyzer only analyzes simple calls to constructors. More complex initializer expressions may lead to missed warnings. For example, the analyzer can't tell whether a temporary guard used as a function call argument deliberately only protects that function call or is a mistake by the user. The analyzer ignores locks passed as arguments to function calls or returned as results of function calls. To provide similar protection for types returned by a function call, annotate them with `[[nodiscard]]`. The analyzer also ignores locks created as temporaries but assigned to named references to extend their lifetime.

Code analysis name: `NO_UNNAMED_GUARDS`

## Example

In this example the name of the scoped lock is missing.

```cpp
void print_diagnostic(std::string_view text)
{
    auto stream = get_diagnostic_stream();
    if (stream)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex>{ diagnostic_mutex_ }; // C26441
        write_line(stream, text);
    }
}
```

To fix the error, give a name to the lock, which extends its lifetime.

```cpp
void print_diagnostic(std::string_view text)
{
    auto stream = get_diagnostic_stream();
    if (stream)
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock{ diagnostic_mutex_ };
        write_line(stream, text);
    }
}
```
