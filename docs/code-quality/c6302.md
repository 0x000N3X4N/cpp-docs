# Warning C6302

> Format string mismatch: character string passed as parameter '\**number*' when wide character string is required in call to '\**function*'

This warning indicates that a format string is being passed a narrow character string when a wide character string is specified.

## Remarks

This issue will likely cause the output to be malformed or for the program to crash at runtime.

Code analysis name: CHAR_WCHAR_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION

## Example

The following code generates this warning. `buff` is a narrow character string, but `wprintf_s` is the wide string variant of `printf_s` and so expects `%s` to be wide:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[5] = "hi";
    wprintf_s(L"%s", buff);
}
```

The following sample code remediates this issue by using `%hs` to specify a single-byte character string:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[5] = "hi";
    wprintf_s(L"%hs", buff);
}
```
