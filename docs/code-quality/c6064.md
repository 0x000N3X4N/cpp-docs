# Warning C6064

> Missing integer argument to '\**function-name*' corresponding to conversion specifier '\**number*'

This warning indicates that not enough arguments are being provided to match a format string and one of the missing arguments is an integer.

## Remarks

This defect is likely to cause incorrect output and, in more dangerous cases, can lead to stack overflow.

Code analysis name: MISSING_INTEGER_ARGUMENT_TO_FORMAT_FUNCTION

## Example

The following code generates this warning because an incorrect number of arguments were used in call to `sprintf_s` and the missing argument was an integer. Had `sprintf` been used instead of the safer variant `sprintf_s`, this code would likely cause a stack overflow instead of just an expected output:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[8];
    char *string="Hello";
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %d", string);  // Attempts to print "Hello 256" or approximate, which cannot fit in the 8 char buffer
}
```

To correct this warning, specify missing arguments as shown in the following code:

```cpp
void f()
{
    char buff[8];
    char *string = "Hello";
    sprintf_s(buff, sizeof(buff), "%s %d", string, strlen(string));
}
```
