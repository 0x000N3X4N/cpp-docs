# Compiler warning C5267

> definition of implicit copy constructor/assignment operator for '*type*' is deprecated because it has a user-provided assignment operator/copy constructor

## Remarks

Since C++11, when only the copy constructor or copy assignment operator is explicitly defined, implicitly generating the other is deprecated. However, to preserve backwards compatibility, the special functions are still implicitly generated.

## Example

The following code shows warning C5267 when an implicitly generated special function is called but isn't explicitly defined:

```cpp
// C5267.cpp
// compile using: /W4 /w45267
struct CopyCtorOnly
{
    CopyCtorOnly() = default;
    CopyCtorOnly(const CopyCtorOnly&) {}   // C5267
};

struct CopyAssignOpOnly
{
    CopyAssignOpOnly() = default;
    CopyAssignOpOnly& operator=(const CopyAssignOpOnly&)   // C5267
    {
        return *this;
    }
};

int main()
{
    CopyCtorOnly a1, a2;
    a1 = a2; // Calls deprecated copy assignment operator

    CopyAssignOpOnly b1;
    CopyAssignOpOnly b2 = b1; // Calls deprecated copy constructor
}
```

To resolve this issue, explicitly define the missing copy constructor or copy assignment operator.
