# Compiler warning (level 4) C5267

> definition of implicit copy constructor/assignment operator for '*type*' is deprecated because it has a user-provided assignment operator/copy constructor

## Remarks


 
This warning is off by default.
This warning was introduced in Visual Studio 17.6

## Example

The following code shows warning C5267 when an implicitly generated special function is called but isn't explicitly defined. Both `/W4` and `/w45267` are required to produce this warning.

```cpp
// C5267.cpp
// compile using: /W4 /w45267
struct CopyCtorOnly
{
    CopyCtorOnly() = default;
    CopyCtorOnly(const CopyCtorOnly&) {} // C5267
};

struct CopyAssignOpOnly
{
    CopyAssignOpOnly() = default;
    CopyAssignOpOnly& operator=(const CopyAssignOpOnly&) // C5267
    {
        return *this;
    }
};

int main()
{
    CopyCtorOnly a1, a2;
    a1 = a2; // Calls deprecated copy assignment operator

    CopyAssignOpOnly b1;
    CopyAssignOpOnly b2 = b1; // Calls deprecated copy constructor
}
```

To resolve this issue, explicitly define the missing copy constructor or copy assignment operator.
